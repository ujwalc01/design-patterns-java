Design-Pattern-Java

**Overview** -
* In this **Spring Boot application**, we will demonstrate the use of various design patterns, such as:

  1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensuring a single instance of a service (LoggerService).
  2. **Factory Pattern**: Creating objects without specifying the exact class (NotificationFactory).
  3. **Observer Pattern**: Notifying dependent objects when a subject's state changes.
  4. **Decorator Pattern**: Adding responsibilities to objects dynamically (CarDecorator).
  5. **Strategy Pattern**: Defining a family of algorithms (PaymentStrategy).
  6. **Command Pattern**: Encapsulating a request as an object (OrderCommand).

* This project will include a **Controller** that exposes HTTP endpoints and utilizes these design patterns. Also utilized Postman for API testing.
